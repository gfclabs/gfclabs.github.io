        <p> Welcome to my personal website! </p>
        <p>
           My goal with this page is to provide insight on some of the cool projects I am working on as well as share some of my ideas through blog posts. 
           This site is in its infancy and needs some work, but check in soon as I am in the process of developing some new content! 
           I have some tex documents that I am spinning into blog posts and I have a surprise interactive dashboard in the making. 
           Thanks for stopping by. 
        </p>
        <p>- George</p>
