Hello! 

My name is George Chamoun and I am currently a Data Scientist at Health Data Analytics Institute (HDAI), in Dedham MA. Currently, I manage a group dedicated to algorithm development, data enginnering, and product integration. 
Prior to working at HDAI I was a statistician at the Lown Institute in Brookline. 
During my time at Lown I published 2 papers in colaboration with the Cleveland Clinic on using Medicare claims to forecast inpatient mortality risk. 
I have my bachelors in economics and mathematics from Northeastern University in Boston, and went to high school nearby in Needham MA. 

I enjoy building models and writing software to help devliver insights to end users. 
Whether I'm working on a new visualization tool or a new algorithm, the customer is always at the forefront of my mind. 
In my current position I work closely with product development teams to help make sure that predictive analytics are seamlessly integrated into our products. 
I fundamentaly belive that good algorithms should not only deliver strong predictive performance, but that they should also be framed such that they resonate with a broad audience. 
I love what I do and am passionate about helping to build good products. 

Thanks for checking out my site. Please stick around and explore!
